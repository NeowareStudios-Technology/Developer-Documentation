What is redux?
-Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps
-evolved from flux (architecture for building user interfaces, created by facebook)


What does redux do for you?
-gives you a single object with every peice of application state in your entire app
	-What would fall into this category?
		-whether or not navigation on mobile is open
		-whether the shopping cart is open
		-whether an alert message has been triggered
		-data gathered from api
		-etc.
-gives you full state tree of app
	-can see all the different actions that have taken place
-can view state of app when a certain action took place
-makes debugging app easier



How does redux work? (very high level)
-Puts entire state into a single object
-Instead of modifying the state, it takes the current version of the state, modifies what it needs, and returns a new copy of the state


Criticisms of Redux:
-difficult to learn/adds more code
	-complex
	-much jargon
	-this is outweighed by the benefits of Redux (for medium to large apps)
