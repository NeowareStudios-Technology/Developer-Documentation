Name Registry Pattern 
needed to refer to address in human readable form
example: if you wanted to have your UI display a name instead of an ethereum address
LWA Use: use to display usernames of buyers/sellers in ui to decrease complexity.
could be used globally (for multiple dapps) or only for one specific dapp
can return name from inputted address, or return address from inputted name
