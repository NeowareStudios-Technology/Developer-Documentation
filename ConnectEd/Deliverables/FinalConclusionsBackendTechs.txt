********************************************************************************
Backend Services used:

-Google App Engine Standard Environment
	-use Python
	-monitoring/debugging included
	-authentication plugin included
	-versioning included
	-security included 
	-hosting
-Google Cloud Datastore database (noSQL)
-Cloud Storage (large file storage, pics, etc.)
-Google BigQuery for data analysis (can import db from datastore)
-Google Cloud Endpoints for API framework (integrated into GAE standard environment)
-OAuth for authentication protocol
-StackDriver for monitoring, debugging, tracing, and error reporting (integrated into GAE Console)

High Level Architecture:

********************************************************************************
Reasoning for choices:
App Engine Standard Environment
	-Will have familiarity with App Engine due to class
	-Cheaper option of PaaS
	-Comes with many needed features (analytics, security, scaling)
        -more cohesive PaaS
	-Can scale down to 0 if no users are using app
	-faster development than GAE Flexible Environment
-DataStore
	-provides eventual consistency (fine for our needs)
        -higher throughput than sql
        -cheaper than firebase and other options of noSQL
        -seamless integration with GAE
	-provides more Availability and Partition Tolerance, but less Consistency (CAP Theory)
        	-should provide more than good enough consistency for our needs
-Cloud Storage
	-comparable price
	-seamless integration with GAE and DataStore
-BigQuery
	-Can import data from DataStore
	-Used for certain queries that would not be possible with only DataStore
	-seamless integration with DataStore and GAE
-Cloud Endpoints
	-much faster development time due to not needing to develop for different platforms
		-e.g. ios, android, web
		-only need to make one set of code, endpoints does the rest
	-seamless integration with GAE (in fact needed with GAE standard environment)
	-seamless integration with Python
-OAuth
	-trusted by many large companies (including Google)
	-time tested
	-seamless integration with GAE
-Stackdriver
	-standard for monitoring cloud systems (Amazon uses this as well)
	-already integrated into GAE
