Exchange architecture timeline

Week 1 (6/1 - 6/7)
	1) Research other similar Ethereum exchanges for industry standard
		-which logic to implement in smart contracts
		vs. front end
		-which functions to include in which smart
		contracts
		-setup of multiple contracts
		-industry standard exchange related
		functions
	2) Establish requirements of exchange
		-functional requirements
		-non-functional requirements
		-requirements definition (role of system) and specification (how system works)

Week 2 (6/8 - 6/14)
	3) research and Establish design patterns to be used
		-data patterns
		-transaction and value patterns
		-action and control patterns
		-good source: https://www.slideshare.net/mids106/dapp-design-patterns
	4) Establish global architecture
		-external database? IPFS? SWARM?
		-high level ER diagram
	5) establish smart contract design
		-UML class diagram
		-UML sequence diagram
Week 3 (6/15-6/21)
	6) establish API design
		-UML class diagram
		-UML sequence diagram
	7) establish user interface design (functionality-wise)
		- will eventually be javascript with template HTML (for designer to pick up and make look pretty)
	8) create pseudo-code for algorithms needed to implement requirements (step 2)

The yellow paper will be rough drafted in conjunction with each step, with a editing for organization and readability after the final step (8)
