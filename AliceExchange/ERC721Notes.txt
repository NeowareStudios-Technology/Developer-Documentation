Notes:
-use ERC-721 interface for lesson plans?

-"This definition is consistent with the fact that ERC-721 contracts track ownership of other things, such as houses, pictures of kittens or collectable cards. If you gain ownership of a house via ERC-721 then the thing that the ERC-721 contract tracks is the deed, the place where you live is the asset."

-use "tokenMetadata()" function to store hash of lesson plan

-token ownership
-cannot simply map balance to address (like ERC20) because you have to know each unique token that you own
-ERC721 ownership determined by array of toekn indexes or ids mapped to an address
-have to look at each individual token created by the contract since each token value is unique
-in addition to array of token indexes in entire contract, each individual address has an array of token indexes (or ids) that is mapped to their address to show ownership
-instead of checking ownership against a balance (erc20), we need to check ownership against a specific index of a token (erc721)
-can view all tokens with allTokens array
-non-fungible, which again, for the millionth time means that tokens of the same class or contract can hold a different value

-token creation
-use mint() function, which adds token id to allTokens array and calls addTokenTo()
-addTokenTo() updates all global ownership variables
-set token URI data (meta data)with setTokenURI()
-internal mapping of address->metadata is stored to associate metadata with specific token



Conclusions:
-we can use erc721 to represent lesson plans
