Conclusions:
-Using ERC-721 tokens is effectively the same as using a DRM
	-solves proof of ownership, fraud prevention, and transfer of ownership
-challenge: how to stop redistribution once the lesson plan is downloaded
	-social DRM?
	-cloud hosted instead of download?
	-integrate a check mechanism in the AR player apps?

DRM General info (non-blockchain)

Digital rights management (DRM) is a set of access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works.[1] DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies

proponents say that DRM:
-prevents intellectual property from being copied freely
-can help the copywriter maintain artistic control
-can ensure continued revenue streams

opponents say that DRM:
-has no evidence supporting claims of prevented copyright infringement
-serves only to inconvenience legitimate customers
-helps big business stifle innovation and competition
-can cause works to be permanently inaccessable if the DRM scheme changes or if the service is discontinued
-can restrict users from exercising their legal rights under the copyright law (such as backing up copies of CDs or DVDs, lending materials through a library, or using copyrighted materials for research and education under the "fair use doctrine")

Current DRM Solutions (non-blockchain):

Adobe DRM (Adobe Content Server (ACS)):
-server software solution that protects PDF and EPUB files
-ACS protected files can be read from your own customized "Bluefire Reader white label apps" or the free Adobe Digital Editions app on all major platforms
-integrates with existing online bookstore technologies, libraries, and educational solutions
-offers granular permissions-based control over viewing, printing, and copying
-supports multiple business models including purchase, lending, rentals, classroom scenarios and more

Social DRM (concept, not a company or specific product)
-a type of watermarking
-less intrusive type of DRM than intrusive approaches that tend to penalize legal users without seriously impeding the activities of serious pirates
-involves incorporation of unobtrusive (or surreptitious) ownership identity info into a downloadable file so that the origin of the file can be tracked
-social DRM usually used for smaller publications

Amazon DRM
-restricts playback of file to users who have authenticated with a third-party DRM license server
-packages a DRM header in the segments of the file
-DRM packaging includes the info required to contact the license server and any encryption info needed to play a file
-Once the file has been packaged, it is sent to the content distribution network, which can be a service such as Amazon S3 and CloudFront, or a non-AWS service such as Akamai
-After the file has been distributed, the license server needs to be contacted for a license before the file plays
-DRM goes beyond standard encryption by specifying an entire set of protocols for content protection
 


    (1)The content provider (you) calls the DRM license provider with a content key ID to generate a content key.
    (2)The license provider uses the key ID to generate a content key and returns it and a license acquisition URL to the content provider.
    (3)The content provider calls AWS KMS to encrypt the content key, and AWS KMS returns the encrypted content key.
    (4)The content provider calls the package server (Elastic Transcoder) with the encrypted content key, key ID, and license acquisition URL.
    (5)The package server fetches the file to be protected, and bundles it with the DRM information.
    (6)The package server sends the DRM-protected file to the distribution server, which distributes the file.

Apple FairPlay
-DRM scheme developed by Veridisc
-designed to encrypt content packaged using HTTP Live Streaming and is intended for use with all iOS devices
-Apple Fairplay is built into QuickTime player
-Apple orginially used FairPlay to protect content distributed through the iTunes Music Store
-Apple no longer encrypts iTunes Music Downloads, FairPlay DRM is still used in the new Apple Music service for content stored locally
-FairPlay Streaming does not provide DRM rights, enforce policies, authenticate users, or authorize devices
 
1. The app requests to play asset from Apple’s AVfoundation media framework
2. AVfoundation media framework then downloads the m3u8 playlist which contains your content key
3. The media framework will then request the key from the media framework delegate built into the app
4. The app delegate then responds to the media framework to make a request from the FairPlay Streaming Server
5. The delegate then sends the FairPlay Server Playback Content to your Key Server
6. The key server then interprets the Server Playback Content using the Key Security Module and searches for the Content Key
7. When the search is completed the Key Security Module applies the content key
8. The media framework delegate then provides the key response to the media framework
9. The content is now decrypted and the app and device can execute playback

Marlin (DRM)
-DRM platform, created by an open-standards community intiative called the Marlin Developer Community (MDC)
-offers sophisticated copyrights management for playing entertainment and media content (including, audio, video, ebooks, and games) distributed over mobile, broadband, broadcast, and all other popular channels
-Since Marlin is not a proprietary DRM, it is able to deliver content over any network or physical media
-ports licensed content across devices and services in a consumer’s home or personal domain and supports a large and flexible set of business models for content distribution, including yet-to-be-defined business models
-Intertrust, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Sony co-founded the Marlin DRM standard in 2005

Intel Files patent for using blockchain for downloading the rights to digital images (3/8/18)

Platform:
-blockchain used to document and verify attributs of digital content relevant to copyright protection
	-e.g. identifier for author of content, creation timestamp, 
	measurement to identify copying or modification of content
-platform uses several types of software to automatically assess copyright policy settings for each image, even if picture was taken from external sources
-platform creates unique identity for both the original content and any modified versions
	-these identities called "shadow images"
-platform allows users to maintain works in progress

(take with grain of salt/ author not vetted)
Ethereum Quantum Protocols (ERC20 + ERC721) for digital assets:

-Ethereum blockchain can solve these problems(proof of ownership, fraud prevention, transfer of ownership) by combining ERC721 tokens with ER20 tokens in a "Quantum Protocol" system
-2 things must be done:
	-keep erc721 smart contract logic lightweight
		-limit amount of info embedded into the smart contract
	-make erc721 tokens interchangable with fungible erc20 
	tokens, which can be easily bought and sold

Smart contracts & digital rights management (DRM)

prevention of copying
-encrypt the information
-social drm (e.g. place name of official buyer in digital asset so that it can be tracked)

From Stateless to State Aware DRM
-stateless DRM:
	-prevents duplication
	-prevents distribution

	-once you encrypt the info with a specific key, you cannot 
	change that key
		-if someone unintended finds the key, you are out of 
		luck

-state aware DRM
	-knows original creator, owner
	-knows statistics on readers
	-renumeration of original creators, owners when a transfer
	happens

	-because on blockchain, can add information to digital 
	asset (da)and it will be difficult to tamper with 	(immutability)

-this lecture seems to apply more to digital assets of which the entirety of the asset is stored on the blockchain
